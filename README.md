BMI Calculator
BASIC BMI CALCULATOR – JAVA

A simple console-based Java application that calculates a user's
Body Mass Index (BMI) using their height and weight.

This project is designed for beginners learning Java and demonstrates:

User input handling

Mathematical calculations

Conditional logic

Clean program structure

FEATURES

Accepts user input for:

Weight in kilograms (kg)

Height in meters (m)

Calculates BMI using the standard formula

Displays:

Exact BMI value

BMI Category:

Underweight

Normal weight

Overweight

Obese

Handles real-world health classification logic

Simple and beginner-friendly code

TECHNOLOGIES USED

Java

Scanner class for user input

HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM

Save the file as:
BMICalculator.java

Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder

Compile the program:
javac BMICalculator.java

Run the program:
java BMICalculator

BMI FORMULA USED

BMI = weight / (height × height)

Where:

Weight is measured in kilograms (kg)

Height is measured in meters (m)

BMI CATEGORIES

Less than 18.5 → Underweight
18.5 to 24.9 → Normal weight
25.0 to 29.9 → Overweight
30.0 and above → Obese

EXAMPLE OUTPUT

Enter your weight in kilograms: 70
Enter your height in meters: 1.75
Your BMI is: 22.85
Category: Normal weight
